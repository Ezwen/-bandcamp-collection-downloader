=== Bandcamp authentication

This tool does not manage authentication with Bandcamp servers, as they require a valid token from Google Captcha. Hence, authentication must first be achieved using Firefox. Then there are two possibilities:

- If running a Windows or Linux system (and if the `--cookies-file` parameter is not used), then the tool will automatically find the required cookies in the Firefox profile folder of the system user. *This approach is now incompatible with versions of Firefox prior to 74.0*.
- Else, Bandcamp cookies must be exported in JSON using the Firefox Addon https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-quick-manager/[Cookie Quick Manager] or in text format with this Chrome Addon https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookiestxt/njabckikapfpffapmjgojcnbfjonfjfg?hl=en[cookies.txt].  The output, either txt from cookies.txt or JSON from Cookie Quick Manager, can then be used using the parameter `--cookies-file`

=== Usage

Example of command:

[source,dtd]
----
$ java -jar bandcamp-collection-downloader.jar --cookies-file=cookies.json --download-folder=~/Music myBandcampIdentifier
----

This will download all albums ever bought by the Bandcamp account _myBandcampIdentifier_, and extract the music in the folder `~/Music`, The tool always creates one folder per artist, each containing one folder per album (with the format `<year> - <album name>`).

After downloading the first album, it will create a `bandcamp-collection-downloader.cache` file in the chosen download folder. This allows the tool to remembers which albums have already been successfully downloaded, and thus prevents unnecessarily hitting the Bandcamp servers.

=== Compiling

The tool is written in Kotlin and compilation is handled by Gradle. A Gradle task named `fatJar` is available to build a standalone executable jar with all dependencies:

....
$ git clone https://framagit.org/Gwendal/bandcamp-collection-downloader.git
$ cd bandcamp-collection-downloader
$ gradle fatjar
....

The resulting binary can then be found in `build/libs/bandcamp-collection-downloader.jar`.

=== Dependencies

This tool relies on the following libraries:

- https://jsoup.org/[jsoup] to get and parse HTML,
- https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-zip[zt-zip] to unzip downloaded albums,
- https://picocli.info/[picocli] to provide a fancy CLI,
- https://github.com/google/gson[Gson] to parse JSON files,
- http://ini4j.sourceforge.net/[[ini4j]] to parse INI files,
- https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc[sqlite-jdbc] to read SQLite files.
